          <h3>From todays featured article</h3>
          <p>Doug Ring was a member of the Australian cricket team that toured England in 1948. Ring played under captain Donald Bradman, whose 1948 team went undefeated in their 34 matches, earning them the sobriquet "The Invincibles". A leg spinner, Ring was not prominent in the series, playing in only the Fifth Test, taking one wicket for 44 runs and scoring nine runs in his only innings. Ring took 60 first-class wickets at a bowling average of 21.81, the most expensive among Australia's frontline bowlers. As England agreed to have a new ball available at intervals of 55 overs after the start of each innings, fast bowling dominated over spin in the Tests, and Ring was used primarily in the non-Test tour matches. Ring scored 150 first-class runs at a batting average of 16.66 during the tour, and a top-score of 53 was his only effort beyond 50.
